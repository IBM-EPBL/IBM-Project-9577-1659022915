A Novel Method for Handwritten Digit Recognition System

**Problem Statement:**
With the progress in the field of science and technology, everything is being digitized to reduce human effort. Hence, there comes a need for handwritten digit recognition in many real-time applications.

**Objective:**
Handwriting recognition is one of the compelling research works going on because every individual in this world has their own style of writing. It is the capability of the computer to identify and understand handwritten digits or characters automatically. The proposed model focuses on MNIST data set which is widely used for this recognition process and it has 70000 handwritten digits. The project uses Artificial neural networks to train these images and build a deep learning model. Web application is created where the user can upload an image of a handwritten digit. this image is analysed by the model and the detected result is returned on to UI.
